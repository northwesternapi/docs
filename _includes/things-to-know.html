<p>The base URL for the Course Data API is below:</p>
<pre>
http://api.asg.northwestern.edu/
</pre>
<p>The API is also accessible using HTTPS. You'll need to do this to avoid browser warnings if the application making the requests is served over HTTPS.</p>
<p>All responses are formatted in JSON (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" target="_blank">JavaScript Object Notation</a>). Responses are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip" target="_blank">gzipped</a> when possible&mdash;include an <code>Accept-Encoding: gzip</code> header in your requests to enable this and reduce bandwidth usage by 70-90%.</p>
<p>You can specify sites from which to allow cross-site requests using your API key. For instance, adding <code>www.example.com</code> as an allowed referrer will cause an <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: www.example.com</code> header to be included in responses.</p>
